Project 2 - RPI FS HAT by Peter Dalmaris

My version of the Raspberry PI HAT Project. This project is based on the "Kicad like a Pro" book written by Dr. Peter Dalmaris.
I made some modifications:
	- using a 2x08 header socket
	- a different footpring of the push button
	- own silk screen layout
